# microservices-toy-application

The application code is solely for the learning/experimentation purpose and should not be used for production grade! This application is an attempt to put the event-driven architecture into the play and hence also ignoring some corner cases of the event styled architecture.

Most of the modules(even, Event Bus) are built from the scratch to understand the underlying principles. In real world applications, we have lots of options of multiple sophisticated/optimised services!
